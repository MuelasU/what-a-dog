#  What a Dog

### An iOS app for dog lovers :dog: :heart:

## Overview

What a Dog is an app to detect dog's breed. With it you can take a picture of a dog and the app try to say its breed accordingly to a machine learning classification model. Also, you we provide a collection of existents breeds and general information about them. Furthermore, we tried to implement an augmented reality section for you to see a 3D model of any dog's specific breed.

Take a look at some screenshots:
